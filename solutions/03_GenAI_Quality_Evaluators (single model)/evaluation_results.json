This document proclaimed the American colonies' separation from Great Britain and articulated the principles of individual rights, liberty, and self-governance. It remains a foundational text in U.S. history and political philosophy.\n\n2. **Revolutionary War**: The year 1776 was a pivotal time in the American Revolutionary War (1775â€“1783). The colonies were actively engaged in fighting against British forces to secure their independence. Significant battles, such as the Battle of Long Island and the crossing of the Delaware River by George Washington, occurred during this year.\n\n3. **Common Sense**: Earlier in 1776, Thomas Paine published *Common Sense*, a pamphlet that argued for independence from Britain and the creation of a democratic republic. It had a profound impact on public opinion and helped galvanize support for the revolutionary cause.\n\n4. **Formation of a New Nation**: The events of 1776 set the stage for the creation of a new government and the eventual drafting of the U.S. Constitution in 1787.
