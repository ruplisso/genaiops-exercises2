As the United States expanded westward, debates erupted over whether new territories should permit slavery. The Southern states feared losing political power and economic security if slavery were restricted, while many in the North opposed its expansion on moral and economic grounds.\n\nKey events that heightened tensions included:\n\n1. **The Missouri Compromise (1820)**: This temporarily resolved the issue of slavery in new states but highlighted the growing sectional divide.\n2. **The Compromise of 1850**: This included the controversial Fugitive Slave Act, which angered many Northerners.\n3. **The Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854)**: This allowed territories to decide the issue of slavery through popular sovereignty, leading to violent conflict in \"Bleeding Kansas.\"\n4. **The Dred Scott decision (1857)**: The Supreme Court ruled that African Americans could not be citizens and that Congress had no authority to prohibit slavery in the territories, further inflaming tensions.\n5. **The election of Abraham Lincoln (1860)**: Lincoln's anti-slavery platform led Southern states to fear that their way of life was under threat, prompting secession.\n\nUltimately, the Southern states seceded from the Union to protect their institution of slavery, forming the Confederate States of America.
