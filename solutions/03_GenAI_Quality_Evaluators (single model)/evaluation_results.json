This document proclaimed the American colonies' separation from Great Britain and articulated the principles of individual rights, liberty, and self-governance. It remains a foundational text in U.S. history and political philosophy.\n\n2. **Revolutionary War**: The year 1776 was a pivotal moment in the American Revolutionary War (1775â€“1783). The colonies were actively engaged in fighting against British forces to secure their independence. Notable battles during this year included the Battle of Long Island and the Battle of Trenton, which demonstrated the resilience and strategic ingenuity of the Continental Army under General George Washington.\n\n3. **Common Sense**: Earlier in the year, in January 1776, Thomas Paine published *Common Sense*, a pamphlet that argued for independence from Britain and the creation of a democratic republic. It was widely read and had a profound impact on public opinion, galvanizing support for the revolutionary cause.\n\n4. **Formation of a New Government**: The Continental Congress began laying the groundwork for governance, including drafting the Articles of Confederation (adopted in 1777), which would serve as the first constitution of the United States.\n\nOverall, 1776 symbolizes the birth of the United States as a nation committed to the ideals of freedom, equality, and self-determination.
