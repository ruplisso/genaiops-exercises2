It proclaimed the American colonies' separation from Great Britain and articulated the principles of individual rights, liberty, and self-governance. This date is celebrated annually as Independence Day in the United States.\n\n2. **Revolutionary War**: The year 1776 was a pivotal moment in the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783). The colonies were actively engaged in fighting against British forces to secure their independence. Notable battles during this year included the Battle of Long Island and the Battle of Trenton, which demonstrated the resilience and strategic ingenuity of the Continental Army under General George Washington.\n\n3. **Common Sense**: Earlier in the year, in January 1776, Thomas Paine published *Common Sense*, a pamphlet that argued for independence from Britain and the establishment of a democratic republic. It had a profound impact on public opinion and helped galvanize support for the revolutionary cause.\n\n4. **Formation of a New Nation**: The events of 1776 set the stage for the creation of a new nation based on Enlightenment ideals of freedom, equality, and self-determination.

While there were other contributing factors, such as economic differences, states' rights, and political tensions, the issue of slavery was at the heart of the sectional divide between the Northern and Southern states.\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Slavery and Its Expansion**: The Southern economy relied heavily on slavery, particularly for its agricultural system, while the Northern states were increasingly industrialized and had largely abolished slavery. The debate over whether slavery should be allowed in new territories and states created intense political and social divisions.\n\n2. **States' Rights**: Southern leaders argued that states had the right to govern themselves and make decisions about slavery without interference from the federal government. However, this argument was often tied directly to the preservation of slavery.\n\n3. **Economic Differences**: The North and South had distinct economic systems. The industrialized North favored tariffs and policies that supported manufacturing, while the agrarian South opposed these measures, fearing they would harm their economy, which was heavily dependent on slave labor.\n\n4. **Election of Abraham Lincoln**: Lincoln's election in 1860 was a tipping point. Although he initially sought to prevent the expansion of slavery rather than abolish it outright, Southern states viewed his presidency as a direct threat to their way of life and began seceding from the Union.\n\n5. **Secession and Formation of the Confederacy**: Following Lincoln's election, 11 Southern states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, explicitly citing the protection of slavery as a central reason for their secession in their declarations and documents.\n\nWhile other factors played a role, the institution of slavery and its future in the United States was the central issue that led to the Civil War.", "inputs.query": "What was the primary cause of the American Civil War?", "inputs.context": "The conflict between the Northern and Southern states escalated over issues including states' rights and slavery.", "inputs.ground_truth": "Slavery", "outputs.relevance.relevance": 4, "outputs.relevance.gpt_relevance": 4, "outputs.relevance.relevance_reason": "The RESPONSE fully addresses the QUERY with accurate and complete information, making it a complete response.", "outputs.coherence.coherence": 4, "outputs.coherence.gpt_coherence": 4, "outputs.coherence.coherence_reason": "The RESPONSE is coherent, well-structured, and effectively addresses the QUERY with logical organization and clear connections between ideas.
