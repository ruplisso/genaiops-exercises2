    "### 🎯 Goal of the Exercise  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll explore how to effectively evaluate the quality of AI-generated content using **multiple AI models simultaneously**. You can work with a **Composite evaluator** to measure performance across different built-in AI-assisted evaluation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this hands-on activity, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up and configure multiple Azure OpenAI model endpoints.\n",
    "- Load, preprocess, and prepare datasets for evaluation tasks.\n",
    "- Run automated evaluations and systematically compare model outputs.\n",
    "- Analyze results to identify which AI models perform best on specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this exercise, you'll gain practical experience in multi-model evaluations, enabling you to make informed decisions when selecting or optimizing AI models for your specific use cases."
