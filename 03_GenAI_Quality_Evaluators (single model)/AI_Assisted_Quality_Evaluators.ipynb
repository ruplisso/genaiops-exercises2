    "# 🎯 Goal of the Exercise  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll learn how to evaluate the **quality of AI-generated text responses** using advanced, AI-assisted evaluators such as **Relevance**, **Coherence**, **Fluency**, **Groundedness**, and custom-built evaluators. Your tasks involve implementing, configuring, and applying these evaluators to ensure generated content meets high-quality standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this exercise, you'll gain practical experience in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying the key dimensions of text quality (relevance, coherence, fluency, groundedness).\n",
    "- Leveraging AI-assisted built-in evaluators (*LLM-as-a-judge*) to assess text outputs.\n",
    "- Creating custom evaluators tailored to your specific use cases or quality standards."
